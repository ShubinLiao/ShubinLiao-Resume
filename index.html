        To Success and Prosperity<br><br>
        Hello! My name's Shubin Liao. I'm currently a student at UCR and a major in Pre-Business, going into Finance. I've chosen to focus on this specific field of the business world because this path is the gateway to a successful future that will ensure a stable financial foundation and generate long-term profit. I'm committed to pursuing a career that yields a lot of wealth because I believe that money does buy happiness, and if one is not happy even though they have lots of money, they're just not spending their money right. Money is also a way to rise up the ranks in the social hierarchy and higher ranks opens up greater opportunities for even more wealth and social influence. I'd like to ascend the ranks since I come from the bottom of the hierarchy. Being from a working-class family, I've witnessed the numerous issues that plagues family members who have to rise up at 5 in the morning to go on a 12-hour shift that barely generates more than the minimum wage. Despite all their hard work, their annual earnings barely surpass half of the national average salary. Other family members also had to take up more workload so our household income would reach a more somewhat considerable amount. Seeing how many hours and energy my family members have to commit to just to reach an acceptable living standard makes me strive for a financial career that would ease up so many of the financial issues that would hit my family every now and then. I'd also like to be able to provide for my aging parents and let them see that all their efforts weren't in vain and did produce a successful son. Additionally, I'd like to not pursue a career where I have to trade my hours for dollars as I believe this is a safe but inefficient way of generating income. If I do fall in a position, where my income is based on how much time I've worked, I plan to use the income I've gotten from that occupation to make investments that will generate much more income in the future. Besides, if people have the option to, I doubt anyone would want to toil away at their workplace and instead go on a vacation or a more entertaining activity whilst generating revenue on the side. Other than the wealth, a major reason I'm dedicated to this career path is because of the change of status quo that it'll provide me. I've been going through the same daily routine for years now and I don't think I could continue this for another decade or more. I'd like to go and do something significant for once, travel to another country, hit a personal record for the most amount of money made in a day, etc. Not only would this career build up my wealth, but it would also help me develop my characteristics and help carve out my distinct individual identity. May I find success and happiness in the future.
